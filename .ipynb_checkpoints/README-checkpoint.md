The goal of my analysis of these datasets is to determine if atmospheric CO2 has an effect on marine CO2 levels. My goals are to create figures that display the data in a way that is easy to answer the question. The graphs I generated display atmospheric CO2 over time and marine DIC over time from three different stations. All of these graphs show a general trend of increasing carbon concentrations in all four datasets over time.
